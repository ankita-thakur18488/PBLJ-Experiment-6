implement Java program that uses lambda expressions and Stream API to filter students who scored above 75%, sort them by marks, and display their names.

Step 1: Create the Student Class
- Define a Student class with attributes:
    name (String)
    marks (double)
- Implement a constructor to initialize these values.
- Add a display method to print student details.

Step 2: Create the StudentFilterSort Class
- Create a list of students with sample data.
- Use Streams API to:
      Filter students who scored above 75%.
      Sort students by marks in descending order.
      Collect the results into a new list.
- Use forEach() with a method reference to display results.ts.


Test Case	                        Input Data	                                                 Expected Output
Case 1:         Normal Case	Alice (80), Bob (72), Charlie (90), David (65), Eve (85)	         Charlie, Eve, Alice (Sorted by marks)
Case 2:         All Below 75%	Bob (70), David (60), Frank (65)	                               No output (Empty List)
Case 3:         Same Marks	Alice (80), Bob (80), Charlie (85)                                 Charlie, Alice, Bob (Sorted by marks, then by name)
Case 4:         Single Student Above 75%	Alice (60), Bob (50), Charlie (90)	                 Charlie (Only one student)
