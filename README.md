## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 6: Develop Java programs using lambda expressions and stream operations for sorting, filtering, and processing large datasets efficiently..

| Program    | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **[6.1) Easy](/Exp6.1.java)** |Write a program to sort a list of Employee objects (name, age, salary) using lambda expressions.. |
| **[6.2) Medium](/Exp6.2.java)** |Create a program to use lambda expressions and stream operations to filter students scoring above 75%, sort them by marks, and display their names. |
| **[6.3) Hard](/Exp6.3.java)** | Write a Java program to process a large dataset of products using streams. Perform operations such as grouping products by category, finding the most expensive product in each category, and calculating the average price of all products. |
